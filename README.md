# 👋 Hi, I'm Patrik Ščerba  
### 🚀 Java Backend Developer | Java • Spring Boot • MySQL • JDBC | REST APIs

I am a highly disciplined developer with a clear goal — to become a professional Java engineer.  
I learn through real projects and iterative versions of my applications, where I build practical, hands-on experience.

I focus on backend development, databases, and application architecture, while gradually moving toward full-stack development.

### Mindset
I believe in consistent work, discipline, and long-term growth.  
My approach is simple: **results instead of excuses.**

# 🧩 My Main Projects

## 🔹 EvidenciaFitnesKlientov v1.0 (XML Version)
**Tech Stack:** Java • Swing • XML  
A simple but fully functional version of a fitness client management system.  
- Register, edit, delete clients  
- Data stored in XML  
- Input validation  
- Clean UI and logic structure  

📌 GitHub: [View Repository](https://github.com/PatrikScerba/EvidenciaFitnesKlientov)

## 🔹 EvidenciaFitnesKlientov v2.0 (MySQL Version)
**Tech Stack:** Java • Swing • MySQL • JDBC • DAO  
A more professional version with a real database backend.  
- Migration from XML to MySQL  
- Full CRUD using JDBC and PreparedStatements  
- Input validations  
- Better architecture (model • dao • utils • ui)

## 🔹 EvidenciaFitnesKlientov v3.0 (Hybrid + QR System) – *In Progress*
**Tech Stack:** Java • Swing • MySQL + XML • QR (ZXing) • ZIP archiving  
The most advanced version so far.  
- Hybrid storage (XML + MySQL)  
- Architecture: dao • service • utils • ui  
- QR code generation for each client  
- QR codes stored on disk and archived into ZIP files for clean organization  
- Database stores only the QR path, not the image itself  
- Planned features: QR entry scanning, automatic membership renewal  
- Designed for potential real-world use  

📌 GitHub: **Work in progress — repository will be added soon**

## 🔹 EvidenciaFitnesKlientov v4.0 – *Coming Soon*
**Tech Stack:** Spring Boot • REST API • MySQL • JPA/Hibernate • React (Frontend)

The next major version of the Fitness Client Management System — rebuilt as a full-stack application.  
- Modern REST API in Spring Boot  
- Full CRUD operations + validation  
- Secure architecture (Spring Security planned)  
- React frontend with API integration  
- Professional multi-layer architecture (controller • service • repository • entity • DTO)  
- Designed to replace previous desktop versions (v1, v2, v3)

📌 GitHub: *Coming soon*
